 ```

 ## Aim:
 To install Pytest and to write test cases for a program and to test using Pytest.
 ## Pytest:
 It is a testing framework that allows users to write test codes using python
 programming language. It helps you to write simple and scalable test case for
 databases, API’s or UI. Pytest is mainly used for writing tests from simple unit tests to
 complex functional tests.
 ## Procedure:
 Installation on Windows:
 1. Navigate to folder where the python is installed.
 2. Open scripts folder and copy the address location.
 3. Open command prompt and execute “cd copied_address_Location”.
 4. Execute “pip install pytest”. Creating File:
 5. The file to be tested should have name as test_*.py or *_test.py
 6. File should be located in the same folder where pytest module is installed Creating
 a sample program:
7. Function to be tested should has name def test_*();
 8. Inside the function the line to be tested should has assert keyword at the
 beginning.
 ## Terminologies in Pytest:
 ```
 F – Failed 
. – Passed S – Skipped X – xpassed x – xfailed 
Eg: 
Parameterized Addition Program: 
File name: test_parameter.py 
import pytest 
@pytest.mark.parameterize(“input1, input2, output”,[(5,5,10),(3,5,12)]) 
def test_add(input1, input2, output): 
assert input1 + input2 == output 
for execution : execute “pytest test_parameter.py”.
```
## Output:

## Result:
 Thus, we have installed pytest, implemented and executed a parameterized addition
 program and the output is verified successfully.
